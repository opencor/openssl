EVP_KEYMGMT_free,
EVP_KEYMGMT_provider
- EVP key management routines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 typedef struct evp_keymgmt_st EVP_KEYMGMT;

 EVP_KEYMGMT *EVP_KEYMGMT_fetch(OPENSSL_CTX *ctx, const char *algorithm,
                                const char *properties);
 int EVP_KEYMGMT_up_ref(EVP_KEYMGMT *keymgmt);
 void EVP_KEYMGMT_free(EVP_KEYMGMT *keymgmt);
 const OSSL_PROVIDER *EVP_KEYMGMT_provider(const EVP_KEYMGMT *keymgmt);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<EVP_KEYMGMT> is a method object that represents key management
implementations for different cryptographic algorithms.
This method object provides functionality to have providers import key
material from the outside, as well as export key material to the
outside.
Most of the functionality can only be used internally and has no
public interface, this object is simply passed into other functions
when needed.

EVP_KEYMGMT_fetch() looks for an algorithm within the provider that
has been loaded into the B<OPENSSL_CTX> given by I<ctx>, having the
name given by I<algorithm> and the properties given by I<properties>.

EVP_KEYMGMT_up_ref() increments the reference count for the given
B<EVP_KEYMGMT> I<keymgmt>.

EVP_KEYMGMT_free() decrements the reference count for the given
B<EVP_KEYMGMT> I<keymgmt>, and when the count reaches zero, frees it.

EVP_KEYMGMT_provider() returns the provider that has this particular
implementation.

=head1 NOTES

EVP_KEYMGMT_fetch() may be called implicitly by other fetching
functions, using the same library context and properties.
Any other API that uses keys will typically do this.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

EVP_KEYMGMT_fetch() returns a pointer to the key management
implementation represented by an EVP_KEYMGMT object, or NULL on
error.

EVP_KEYMGMT_up_ref() returns 1 on success, or 0 on error.

EVP_KEYMGMT_free() doesn't return any value.

EVP_KEYMGMT_provider() returns a pointer to a provider object, or NULL
on error.
