=head1 NAME

EVP_SIGNATURE_fetch, EVP_SIGNATURE_free, EVP_SIGNATURE_up_ref,
EVP_SIGNATURE_provider
- Functions to manage EVP_SIGNATURE algorithm objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 EVP_SIGNATURE *EVP_SIGNATURE_fetch(OPENSSL_CTX *ctx, const char *algorithm,
                                    const char *properties);
 void EVP_SIGNATURE_free(EVP_SIGNATURE *signature);
 int EVP_SIGNATURE_up_ref(EVP_SIGNATURE *signature);
 OSSL_PROVIDER *EVP_SIGNATURE_provider(const EVP_SIGNATURE *signature);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EVP_SIGNATURE_fetch() fetches the implementation for the given
B<algorithm> from any provider offering it, within the criteria given
by the B<properties>.
The algorithm will be one offering functions for performing signature related
tasks such as signing and verifying.
See L<provider(7)/Fetching algorithms> for further information.

The returned value must eventually be freed with EVP_SIGNATURE_free().

EVP_SIGNATURE_free() decrements the reference count for the B<EVP_SIGNATURE>
structure. Typically this structure will have been obtained from an earlier call
to EVP_SIGNATURE_fetch(). If the reference count drops to 0 then the
structure is freed.

EVP_SIGNATURE_up_ref() increments the reference count for an B<EVP_SIGNATURE>
structure.

EVP_SIGNATURE_provider() returns the provider that I<signature> was fetched from.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

EVP_SIGNATURE_fetch() returns a pointer to an B<EVP_SIGNATURE> for success
or B<NULL> for failure.

EVP_SIGNATURE_up_ref() returns 1 for success or 0 otherwise.

=head1 HISTORY

The functions described here were added in OpenSSL 3.0.
